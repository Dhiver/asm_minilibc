# ASM mini-LibC

School project where I had to develop a mini-LibC in Assembly x86_64.

Recoded functions:

* memcpy
* memmove
* memset
* rindex
* strcasecmp
* strchr
* strcmp
* strcspn
* strlen
* strncmp
* strpbrk
* strstr
* strdup

To compile the shared library libasm.so just run `make`.

To compile and run the unit tests, go in `tests` folder and run `make tests`.
